# Why do you want me to sign this thing?

`replicad` is a lot of work. I want to have people benefit from it as much as
possible. This means that I want it to be open source. But I also want to be
able to benefit from it if people build a business on top of it.

So I went for a licensing scheme that uses AGPL so that the open source
community benefit from it, while asking contributor to sign this CLA so that
I can sell licenses exceptions to business who want to use the code without
disclosing the source.

I am not a lawyer, and might be completely wrong about my approach, please
contact me if I am doing something wrong here!
